- Configure the FMCW waveform based on the system requirements.
- Define the range and velocity of target and simulate its displacement.
- For the same simulation loop process the transmit and receive signal to determine the beat signal
- Perform Range FFT on the received signal to determine the Range
- Towards the end, perform the CFAR processing on the output of 2nd FFT to display the target.

Theory :

FMCW transmit and received signals are defined using wave equations, where 
α = Slope  of  the  signal. The Transmit Signal is given by:

<img width="188" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2065ea4d-7e81-404c-b408-e74ed92fa3e5">


The received signal is the time delayed version of the Transmit Signal which is defined by (t−τ), where τ represents the delay time, which in radar processing is the trip time for the signal.
Replacing t with (t−τ) gives the Receive Signal:

On mixing these two signals, we get the beat signal, which holds the values for both range as well as doppler. By implementing the 2D FFT on this beat signal, we can extract both Range and Doppler information

The beat signal can be calculated by multiplying the Transmit signal with Receive signal. This process in turn works as frequency subtraction. It is implemented by element by element multiplication of transmit and receive signal matrices.

Mixed or Beat Signal = (Tx.*Rx) 
The above operation gives:

```ruby
% FMCW Waveform Generation
B = c / (2 * rangeResolution); % Bandwidth
Tchirp = 5.5 * (2 * maxRange / c); % Chirp time (factor of 5.5 is typical)
slope = B / Tchirp; % Slope of the FMCW chirp

% Operating carrier frequency of Radar 
fc= 77e9;
              
% The number of chirps in one sequence. Its ideal to have 2^ value for the ease of running the FFT for Doppler Estimation. 
Nd=128;

% The number of samples on each chirp. 
Nr=1024;

% Timestamp for running the displacement scenario for every sample on each chirp
t=linspace(0,Nd*Tchirp,Nr*Nd); %total time for samples

% Creating the vectors for Tx, Rx and Mix based on the total samples input.
Tx=zeros(1,length(t)); %transmitted signal
Rx=zeros(1,length(t)); %received signal
Mix = zeros(1,length(t)); %beat signal

% Similar vectors for range_covered and time delay.
r_t=zeros(1,length(t));
td=zeros(1,length(t));
```

The for loop bellow simulates the behavior of an FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) radar system over time. It calculates the radar signals for each time step, considering a target moving with a constant velocity. By doing the following steps:
1. Iterating Over Time:
` for i = 1:length(t)`: The loop runs for each time step in the time vector t. The `length(t)` function returns the total number of time points, so the loop will execute that many times.

2. Updating the Target's Range:
- `r_t(i) = initialPosition + velocity * t(i);`:
The loop calculates the position of the target at each time step. The target's range `(r_t(i))` is updated by adding the distance it has traveled to its initial position. The distance traveled is the product of the target's constant velocity (velocity) and the current time `(t(i))`.
- `td(i) = 2 * r_t(i) / c;`:
The time delay `(td(i))` is computed based on the updated range. This represents the time it takes for the radar signal to travel to the target and back to the radar receiver. The factor of `2` accounts for the round trip, and `c` is the speed of light.

3. Generating the Transmitted and Received Signals:
- `Tx(i) = cos(2 * pi * (frequency * t(i) + (slope * t(i)^2) / 2));`:
This generates the transmitted signal `(Tx)` for the current time step. The signal is a cosine wave whose frequency changes over time according to the slope. This chirped signal is what the radar sends out.
- `Rx(i) = cos(2 * pi * (frequency * (t(i) - td(i)) + (slope * (t(i) - td(i))^2) / 2));`:
The received signal `(Rx)` is generated similarly, but it is delayed by `td(i)` due to the time it takes for the signal to travel to the target and back. This delay causes a frequency shift in the received signal compared to the transmitted signal.

4. Generating the Beat Signal:
`Mix(i) = Tx(i) .* Rx(i);` :
The beat signal `(Mix)` is generated by multiplying the transmitted `(Tx)` and received `(Rx)` signals element-wise. The beat signal contains information about the difference in frequency between the two signals, which is related to the range and velocity of the target. This signal is later used to extract information about the target's position and speed.





```ruby

for i=1:length(t)         
    % For each time stamp update the Range of the Target for constant velocity. 
    r_t(i) = initialPosition + velocity * t(i);
    td(i) = 2 * r_t(i) / c; % Time delay

    % For each time sample we need update the transmitted and received signal. 
    Tx(i) = cos(2 * pi * (frequency * t(i) + (slope * t(i)^2) / 2));
    Rx(i) = cos(2 * pi * (frequency * (t(i) - td(i)) + (slope * (t(i) - td(i))^2) / 2));

    % Now by mixing the Transmit and Receive generate the beat signal
    % This is done by element wise matrix multiplication of Transmit and Receiver Signal
    % Generate the beat signal by mixing Tx and Rx
    Mix(i) = Tx(i) .* Rx(i);    
end
```
### 3. FFT Operation 

The 1D FFT implementation on the mixed/beat signal, outputting a peak at the range of the vehicle:

The 2nd FFT implementation on the mixed/beat signal generate a Range Doppler Map (RDM) as seen in the image below where we can extract both range and doppler information from.

### 4. 2d CFAR 

CFAR implementation:
```

%Slide Window through the complete Range Doppler Map

Tr = 10; % Training cells for range
Td = 8; % Training cells for doppler

% Number of Guard Cells in both dimensions around the Cell under test (CUT) for accurate estimation
Gr = 4; % Guard cells for range
Gd = 4; % Guard cells for doppler
```

The for loop bellow evaluates each cell in the Range-Doppler Map (RDM) to determine whether it represents a target or just noise. By performing CFAR target detection across the entire Range-Doppler Map, excluding the edges. For each cell (CUT), it calculates a noise-based threshold from surrounding cells, then compares the CUT's signal level against this threshold to decide whether the CUT corresponds to a target or just noise. The result is stored in a new matrix `(thresholded_RDM)`, which indicates where targets are detected.

Steps Involved:
1. Initialization:

   `thresholded_RDM = zeros(size(RDM));`
A matrix of zeros with the same size as the RDM is initialized to store the results. After processing, this matrix will contain `1` where a target is detected and `0` where there is no target.

2. Looping Through the RDM:

- Outer Loop `(for i = Tr+Gr+1:(Nr/2)-(Gr+Tr))`:
This loop iterates over the range dimension of the RDM, excluding the edges. The edges are excluded because the cells at the edges don't have enough surrounding cells to calculate the noise level accurately.

- Inner Loop `(for j = Td+Gd+1:Nd-(Gd+Td))`:
This loop iterates over the Doppler (velocity) dimension of the RDM, also excluding the edges.

3. Calculating the Noise Level:

- Summing Power in Training Cells:
  
`noise_level = sum(db2pow(RDM(i-(Tr+Gr):i+(Tr+Gr), j-(Td+Gd):j+(Td+Gd))), 'all');`

The noise level around the CUT is estimated by summing the power of the signals in a region around it. This region includes both the training cells and the guard cells.

- Subtracting Power in Guard Cells:
  
`noise_level = noise_level - sum(db2pow(RDM(i-Gr:i+Gr, j-Gd:j+Gd)), 'all');`

The contribution from the guard cells is subtracted from the total to isolate the noise level.

- Averaging the Noise Level:
  
`noise_level = noise_level / ((2*(Tr+Gr)+1)*(2*(Td+Gd)+1) - (2*Gr+1)*(2*Gd+1));`

The noise level is averaged by dividing by the total number of training cells.

4. Setting the Detection Threshold:

`threshold = pow2db(noise_level) + offset;` 

The noise level is converted back to dB, and an offset (in dB) is added to set the detection threshold. This threshold is what the signal at the CUT will be compared against.

5. Comparing the Signal at CUT with the Threshold:

- `if RDM(i,j) > threshold`
The signal strength at the CUT is compared to the threshold.
- Target Detection:
`thresholded_RDM(i,j) = 1;`
If the signal at the CUT is greater than the threshold, it is considered a target, and the corresponding cell in the `thresholded_RDM` is set to `1`.
- No Detection:
`thresholded_RDM(i,j) = 0;`
If the signal is not greater than the threshold, the cell is set to `0`.

```ruby
% Loop through the RDM, excluding the edges for Training and Guard Cells
for i = Tr+Gr+1:(Nr/2)-(Gr+Tr)
    for j = Td+Gd+1:Nd-(Gd+Td)
        % Compute noise level
        noise_level = sum(db2pow(RDM(i-(Tr+Gr):i+(Tr+Gr), j-(Td+Gd):j+(Td+Gd))), 'all');
        noise_level = noise_level - sum(db2pow(RDM(i-Gr:i+Gr, j-Gd:j+Gd)), 'all');
        noise_level = noise_level / ((2*(Tr+Gr)+1)*(2*(Td+Gd)+1) - (2*Gr+1)*(2*Gd+1));

        % Convert noise level to dB and add offset
        threshold = pow2db(noise_level) + offset;

        % Compare the signal under CUT with the threshold
        if RDM(i,j) > threshold
            thresholded_RDM(i,j) = 1;
        else
            thresholded_RDM(i,j) = 0;
        end
    end
end
```
