# Radar 
Radar works using the transmission and detection of electromagnetic waves as seen in the following image:

The frequency of electromagnetic energy used for radar is unaffected by darkness and penetrates fog and clouds. This permits radar systems to determine the position of road targets that are invisible to the naked eye because of distance, darkness, or weather. The automotive radar generally operates at W band (76GHz - 81GHz). The signal at this frequency is referred to as millimeterWave since the wavelength is in mm.

## FMCW
FMCW radar (Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave radar) is a specialized radar sensor that emits continuous transmission power. Its capability to measure very small distances to a target, along with its ability to simultaneously determine both the target's range and relative velocity, makes it the preferred radar type for automotive applications.

A Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) signal is characterized by a frequency that changes over time, either increasing or decreasing. These variations are commonly referred to as upramps and downramps. The two most common waveform patterns used in FMCW radars are sawtooth and triangular. The sawtooth waveform typically employs only the upramps, while the triangular waveform utilizes both upramps and downramps.

Each chirp is defined by its slope. The slope is given by its chirp frequency bandwidth B or Bsweep (y-axis) and its chirp time Ts (x-axis). Hence, Slope=B/Ts

### FMCW Hardware Overview

**Frequency Synthesizer:** The frequency synthesizer is the component that generates the frequency to bring the chirp frequency all the way to 77GHz in case of automotive radar.

**Power Amp:** The power amp amplifies the signal so the signal can reach long distances. Since the signal attenuates as it radiates, it needs higher power (amplitude) to reach targets at greater distances.

**Antenna:** The antenna converts the electrical energy into electromagnetic waves which radiate through the air, hit the target, and get reflected toward the radar receiver antenna. The Antenna also increases the strength of the signal by focusing the energy on the desired direction. Additionally, the antenna pattern determines the field of view for the radar.

**Mixer:** In FMCW radar, the mixer multiplies the return signal with the sweeping signal generated by the frequency synthesizer. The operation works as frequency subtraction to give the frequency delta - also known as frequency shift or Intermediate frequency (IF). IF = Synthesizer Frequency - Return Signal Frequency.

**Processor:** The processor is the processing unit where all the Digital Signal processing, Detection, Tracking, Clustering, and other algorithms take place. This unit could be a microcontroller or even an FPGA.

## Radar Cross Section
The size and ability of a target to reflect radar energy is defined by a single term, σ, known as the radar cross-section, which has units of m^2. This unit shows that the radar cross section is an area. The target radar cross sectional area depends on:

•	The target’s physical geometry and exterior features:

Smooth edges or surface would scatter the waves in all directions, hence lower RCS. Whereas sharp corners will focus the return signal back in the direction of the source leading to higher RCS. (Image below for different target geometries)

•	The direction of the illuminating radar,

•	The radar transmitter’s frequency,

•	The material used in cars, trucks, bicycles, and even in some cases, the clothing material for pedestrians.

### RCS Units
This RCS can also be defined using a logarithmic value (dB), since it increases the return signal strength. The formula for converting from RCS to dB is given by:

The following table shows RCS values for different targets in both m^2 and dB. You can use the formula above to see how the two columns of the table are related. For example, from the table below we can see that for an automobile:

## Range Equation Overview
Using the Radar Range equation, we can design the radar transmitter, receiver, and antenna to have the desired power, gain and noise performance to meet the range requirements.

A long-range radar designed to cover 300m range and detect a target with smaller cross section would need higher transmit power and more antenna gain as compared to a short range radar designed to cover just 50m for similar target. A target with higher cross section can be detected at a longer range as compared to a target with smaller cross section.

•	**R** - Maximum Range a radar can detect targets.
