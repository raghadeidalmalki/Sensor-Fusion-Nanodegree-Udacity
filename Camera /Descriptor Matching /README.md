Descriptor Matching
Once we locate and describe a set of keypoints for each image in a sequence of frames, the next step in the tracking process is to find the best fit for each keypoint in successive frames. In order to do so, we need to implement a suitable ***similarity measure*** so that the tracking algorithm can uniquely assign keypoint pairs.
